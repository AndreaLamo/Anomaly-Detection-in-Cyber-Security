# Anomaly-Detection-in-Cyber-Security
In this paper we set out to investigate the effectiveness with which cyber-attacks in server-client
networks can be detected with the help of machine learning algorithms. Basing ourselves on previous
research papers, chiefly Al Nuaimi et al., and taking inspiration from pre-existing datasets, mainly
the Edge-IIOT-2022, we pursue to replicate their findings and possibly expand upon them, drawing
further conclusions about the applicability of ML methods in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in
Cyber Security. To this end, we simulate two types of cyber-attacks, Denial of Service (DOS) and
Brute Force (for passwords): we assemble two datasets with the most relevant features and then
evaluate the performance of some easily interpretable (supervised and unsupervised) ML algorithms
on the binary classification problem of distinguishing between normal and anomalous traffic. In this
process, we formulate several hypotheses that are put to the test throughout the paper and take some
assumptions to simplify the otherwise intractable analysis.
