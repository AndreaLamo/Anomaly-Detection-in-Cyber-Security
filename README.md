# Anomaly-Detection-in-Cyber-Security
In this project, we investigate the effectiveness with which cyber-attacks in client-server networks can
be detected with the help of machine learning algorithms. Basing ourselves on previous research papers,
chiefly Al Nuaimi et al., and taking inspiration from pre-existing datasets, mainly the Edge-IIOT-2022,
we pursue to verify their findings and possibly expand them, drawing further conclusions on the
applicability of ML methods in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Cyber Security. To this end, we
simulate two types of cyber-attacks, Denial of Service (DOS) and Brute Force (for passwords): we
assemble two datasets with the most relevant features and then evaluate the performance of some easily
interpretable (supervised and unsupervised) ML algorithms on the binary classification problem of
distinguishing between normal and anomalous traffic. In this process, we formulate several hypotheses
that are tested throughout the paper, and make some assumptions to simplify the otherwise intractable
analysis. In the end, we explore the trade-off between performance and privacy by employing the
Ïµ-differential privacy technique.
